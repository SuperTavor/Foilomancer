# Foilomancer
A tool for making and applying mods for YKW1 Smartphone without the fear of piracy..

**Features**:
*Pack your mod inside a FLC file, a custom file type made exclusvely for Foilomancer compatible mods*

*Don't be afraid of piracy! Foilomancer can't work if you don't have a copy of the game installed on your device.*

*Fully compatible with Prinjector2*

**Why Foilomancer?**
Up until now, the method of applying mods required extracting your game, taking one of the 4 split apks, opening it, inserting the mod, resigning ALL of the apks. Foilomancer just works. it's a 1 click install for all your mods.

**Can it work on iOS?**
if I had an iOS device to test on, I probably could port it. unfortunately, I don't.

**How can I make Foilomancer compatible mods?**
Open FoilomancerGUI on your computer, connect your phone with ADB. Load the split APK you edited. Foilomancer will then output a FLC file that can work everywhere and doesn't replace the split apk, it just automatically and elegantly applies the changes.

# This tool will also be compatible with the offline version of WibWobReloaded in the future!
